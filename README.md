# Machine Learning Problem-Solving Checklist

> This repo is part of a blog post that I have written [here](/)

  **TL;DR**
  
Remember that solving ML problems requires a certain level of creativity. Although, using this checklist can help you, but you might get a better outcome if you try to change or bend the checklist a bit. 

Since there is no set-in-stone rule to do this, you can even derive your own version of the checklist yourself. 

Don't be afraid to take risks here. It will contribute much more to your learning than you think.

# The Checklist

## 1. Get A Footing
  - [ ] Point out the gray areas
  - [ ] Prepare questionaire
  - [ ] Ask questions and note their responses
  - [ ] Create a mind map
  - [ ] Create a Data flow/Data pipeline diagram
  - [ ] Share what you understood with stakeholders and validate it
  - [ ] Ask: What does the solution look like? How should it work?
  - [ ] Design/plan your solution:
    - [ ] Select a performance measure
    - [ ] Select model(s)
    - [ ] Double check assumptions
  - [ ] Share what you understood with stakeholders and validate it
## 2. Getting Things Ready For Action
  - [ ] Setup your environment
  - [ ] Explore the data (EDA):
    - [ ] Metric analysis
    - [ ] Graphical analysis
    - [ ] Look for correlations
    - [ ] Experiment with attributes
  - [ ] List out potential problems you will face while implementing upcoming phases
  - [ ] Ask supervisor or project owner to fulfill the data which project needs or find alternatives (if applicable) 
  - [ ] Wrangle the Data
    - [ ] Write your transformers (if needed)
    - [ ] Perform feature scaling where needed
    - [ ] Finish by developing a pipeline
## 3. Machine Learning Processing
  - [ ] Select models to train
  - [ ] Train each selected model with training set
  - [ ] Test each model with test set
  - [ ] Evaluate and compare model performances ( cross val;idation )
  - [ ] Cull the _not-so-performant_ models
  - [ ] Fine-tune the remaining models
  - [ ] Pick your best model
  - [ ] Test your final model (_with tuning applied_) against Test set
## 4. Send it out
  - [ ] Export your finished product
  - [ ] Upload it somewhere safe
  - [ ] Make a backup copy
