# Machine Learning Problem-Solving Checklist

> ðŸ“Œ This repo is part of a blog post that I have written [here](https://medium.com/@hammad.ai/machine-learning-problem-solving-checklist-e5584793cc47)

**TL;DR**

This is a Machine Learning Checklist aimed at generalizing the problem solving methodology to suit most scenarios.
  
Remember that solving ML problems requires a certain level of creativity. Although, using this checklist can help you, but you might get a better outcome if you try to change or bend the checklist a bit.Â 

Since there is no set-in-stone rule to do this, you can even derive your own version of the checklist yourself.Â 

Don't be afraid to take risks here. It will contribute much more to your learning than you think.
