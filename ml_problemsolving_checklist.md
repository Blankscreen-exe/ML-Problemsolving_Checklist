## 1. Get A Footing
  - [ ] Point out the gray areas
  - [ ] Prepare questionaire
  - [ ] Ask questions and note their responses
  - [ ] Create a mind map
  - [ ] Create a Data flow/Data pipeline diagram
  - [ ] Share what you understood with stakeholders and validate it
  - [ ] Ask: What does the solution look like? How should it work?
  - [ ] Design/plan your solution:
    - [ ] Select a performance measure
    - [ ] Select model(s)
    - [ ] Double check assumptions
  - [ ] Share what you understood with stakeholders and validate it
## 2. Getting Things Ready ForÂ Action
  - [ ] Setup your environment
  - [ ] Explore the data (EDA):
    - [ ] Metric analysis
    - [ ] Graphical analysis
    - [ ] Look for correlations
    - [ ] Experiment with attributes
  - [ ] List out potential problems you will face while implementing upcoming phases
  - [ ] Ask supervisor or project owner to fulfill the data which project needs or find alternatives (if applicable) 
  - [ ] Wrangle the Data
    - [ ] Write your transformers (if needed)
    - [ ] Perform feature scaling where needed
    - [ ] Finish by developing a pipeline
## 3. Machine Learning Processing
  - [ ] Select models to train
  - [ ] Train each selected model with training set
  - [ ] Test each model with test set
  - [ ] Evaluate and compare model performances ( cross validation )
  - [ ] Cull the _not-so-performant_ models
  - [ ] Fine-tune the remaining models
  - [ ] Pick your best model
  - [ ] Test your final model (_with tuning applied_) against Test set
## 4. Send it out
  - [ ] Export your finished product
  - [ ] Upload it somewhere safe
  - [ ] Make a backup copy
  - [ ] ... (do whatever your job description says at this point)
